// this a beggining of the js learning
// when you want to declare  a js file you use a console.log() format

console.log("hello Brian");

// I am using node js to run the following js commands
// you can also declare a variable the run it using console.log();

let greetings = "Hello Brian";

console.log(greetings);

//its that simple
